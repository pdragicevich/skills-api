* Temperature - by changing our body temperature, we can quickly decrease the intensity of an emotion.
* Intense exercise - by engaging in intense cardio/aerobic exercise, we engage our physical body in a way that de-escalates intense emotions.
* Paired muscle relaxation - practice tensing your muscles as you breathe in for 5-6 seconds. Notice that feeling. Then relax them as you breathe out, paying attention to how that feels as you do it.
* Paced breathing - breath in for 4, hold for 2, breath out for 7.
