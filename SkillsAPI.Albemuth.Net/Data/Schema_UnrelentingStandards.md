The underlying belief that one must strive to meet very high internalized
standards of behavior and performance, usually to avoid criticism. Typically
results in feelings of pressure or difficulty slowing down; and in
hypercriticalness toward oneself and others. Must involve significant impairment
in: pleasure, relaxation, health, self-esteem, sense of accomplishment, or
satisfying relationships.

Unrelenting standards typically present as: (a) perfectionism, inordinate
attention to detail, or an underestimate of how good one's own performance is
relative to the norm; (b) rigid rules and “shoulds” in many areas of life,
including unrealistically high moral, ethical, cultural, or religious precepts;
or (c) preoccupation with time and efficiency, so that more can be accomplished.
