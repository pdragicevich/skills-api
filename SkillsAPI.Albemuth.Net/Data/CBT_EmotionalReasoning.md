This is a style of unhelpful thinking whereby you base your view of situations,
yourself, or others, on the way you are feeling.

Have you ever felt anxious about something and thought to yourself, "I know this
isn't going to work out well" and everything turned out just fine? If you have,
it's likely that you were using emotional reasoning. In this case, we tend to
take our emotions as being evidence for the truth.
