The expectation that others will hurt, abuse, humiliate, cheat, lie, manipulate,
or take advantage. Usually involves the perception that the harm is intentional
or the result of unjustified and extreme negligence. May include the sense that
one always ends up being cheated relative to others or "getting the short end of
the stick."
