Mind reading is assuming what someone else is thinking without having much to go
on. If we rely too much on mind reading, we can make mistakes about what others
think of us, which can really wreak havoc with our mood. Mind reading often
leads to depression and anxiety, especially social anxiety.  

Consequently, it can be helpful to learn to recognize and respond to common
cognitive distortions such as mind reading.
