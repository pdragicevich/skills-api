Negative Filtering is a common cognitive distortion, and most of us do it from
time to time. Simply, it is filtering out all of the positive information about
a specific situation, and only allowing in the negative information.

The key thing to do when you suspect you may be engaging in negative filtering
is to examine the actual evidence. Look around to find instances in which things
are not all bad, and more importantly, things to be grateful for.
