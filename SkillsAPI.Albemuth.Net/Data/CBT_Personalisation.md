summary: "Personalising" is where you assume responsibility for a negative even when there is no basis for doing so
---
The personalisation thinking error involves seeing yourself as the cause of everything negative, even though you are not the one responsible. This often leads to feelings of shame and guilt.

Examples

“My daughter didn’t make the soccer team. I’m sure it’s because I didn’t practice enough with her. ”

“My husband hit me because I’m a bad wife.”

Solutions

Ask yourself:

How do you know that? (In the examples above, how do you know your daughter didn’t make the soccer team because of you? Did the coach say so? How do you know you are a bad wife?)
Challenge yourself to find out just how much responsibility you could truly have for what occurred.
Try to think of external factors that could have also contributed to the situation.
